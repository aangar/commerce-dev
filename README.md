# commerce-dev
this is the development and uploads of my first large-scale app, made for commerce.
okay, so story time: i was bored and figured 'hmmm... how can i make a cool code thingy that people would think is cool later?'
*insert a brief pause.*
*about thirty minutes of google later*
learn react!
needs some time. what can i do *now?*
***more googling***
do e-commerce application! woooo!

the fateful day of 6/28, and then working just about every day for nearly 3+ hours with some off days solo later...
7/15! youve made some of this app work! good job dude!!!
*but theres still more to do. you still have to make-*
...
but here we are.

anyways, this is my first big application, with the name of ***eCom***. its my take at a reselling site, using express, mongoDB, mongoose, and some other cool things i paid to learn.
yes, and that was three months of work on its own. ask my old friends, they remember.
anyways...
ill keep uploading as i go and just have a 'copy' online in case i want to redownload it later and work on it elsewhere, if it wasnt one of my personal devices.

for now, that's all thatll be here on the readme, so yeah, keep tuned :)

**disclaimer : this is going to be stable and full updates ONLY. if you want to see my current progress, check out my eCommerce repo**
